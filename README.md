# Localnorm
This is an implementation of paper Journey to the center of the words: Word weighting scheme based on the geometry of word embeddings.

Setup:
1. Install the python packages in requirements.txt.
2. Keep the STS datasets in datasets folder.
3. Keep the Word embedding files (GloVe, Word2Vec) in data folder. Instructions are given in data folder on how to download them very easily.

Run:
1. Simply, run the localnorm.py file. Current code works with Glove embeddigs.
2. For Word2vec, uncomment lines #201 - #209 and comment out lines #198 - #199.
